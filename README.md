## Currently What is it adding to the game:

### 1. Faz "Prototype"
**Demo Video** (click the picture):

**Ship Description**:

![Faz](https://i.imgur.com/DWzl72N.png)

Pristine white "Needle"-like design, opens up to form a "Wedge" shape when hitting the alt.

``Primary:`` "Torpedo" Fires a single torpedo

``Alt:`` "Empty Silo" Fires as many missiles as it has energy to spare (Basically changes your ship to M-Mode and changes your primary)

**WARNING**:
While Faz Prototype is in M-MODE It **DOES NOT** regenerate It's energy

``Lore/Notes:`` After spending untold millenium trapped on their home planet, possibly even the oldest still living race to have done so, they lost track of their old blueship designs & had to start from scratch with their ship.


### 2. Yuli "Whelk"
**Demo Video** (click the picture):

**Ship Description**:

![Yuli](https://i.imgur.com/U7h3aUm.png)

A massive “pearl”-like object, which houses the Yuli, like an aquarium. From it are several “tentacles” that use their psychic runoff to propel the ship forward; they are multi-colored for the sake of determining direction and setting a course in the vastness of space.

``Primary:`` "Psychic Convergence" A basic pew-pew, the crew of the Whelk gather psychic energy to shoot at the enemy.

``Alt:`` "Manifestation of Dark Thoughts" The Whelk creates a dark copy of itself, piloted by their unwanted & dark emotions. It's basically a turret. Unfortunately it only has 1-HP. This means that literally anything touching it will cause it to evaporate, from a stray asteroid to even the enemy ramming their ship into it!

``Pressing both buttons will transport the Yuli to the Copy, obliterating it.``

### 3. Dnyarri
**Demo Video** (click the picture):

[![DnyarriDemo](https://i.imgur.com/zLbpMcI.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLRc-Bo0vv4)

**Ship Description**:

``Primary:`` "A basic array of pew-pew"

``Alt:`` High-frequency waves capable of controlling the enemy's mind.
**YOUR ENEMY CANNOT USE ITS PRIMARY ATTACK AND CANNOT STOP ITS SHIP FROM MOVING. ALSO SLOWS THE SHIP DOWN**

### 4. Voiced Outtakes of Kzer-Za and Kohr-Ah:
